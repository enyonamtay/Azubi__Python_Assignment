This is a time tracking program designed for Nana's consulting business.
The program allows the user to input the date and the time he started working on a task, and then the date and time when he finished a particular task. 
The program calculates the hours he spent on a task and then calculates the amount of money Nana made tackling the task.
The program employs datetime module to manipulate dates and time inputs as well as pandas library for creating tables and indexes for the results of the manipulation.
Inputs and respective results are stored in an excel file to allow for future referencing.
